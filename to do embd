For each step towards becoming an embedded programmer, here are some resources that can help you on your journey:
1. Understand the Basics of Electronics
•	Books: "Practical Electronics for Inventors" by Paul Scherz and Simon Monk provides a thorough introduction to electronics.
•	Online Courses: Websites like Coursera and edX offer courses on electronics fundamentals. Look for courses titled "Introduction to Electronics" or similar.
2. Learn Programming Languages
•	C/C++:
•	Books: "C Programming Language" by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie for C, and "C++ Primer" by Stanley B. Lippman for C++.
•	Online Platforms: Codecademy, Udemy, and Pluralsight have courses on C and C++ programming.
•	Assembly Language:
•	Books: "Programming from the Ground Up" by Jonathan Bartlett is a good introduction to assembly language.
•	Online Resources: Look for assembly language tutorials specific to the microcontroller you are interested in.
3. Get Familiar with Microcontrollers and Microprocessors
•	Arduino:
•	Official Website: Arduino’s own tutorials (arduino.cc/en/Guide) are a great starting point.
•	ARM Cortex-M:
•	Books: "The Definitive Guide to ARM® Cortex®-M3 and Cortex®-M4 Processors" by Joseph Yiu.
•	Online Resources: ARM’s official documentation and tutorials.
•	Raspberry Pi:
•	Official Website: Raspberry Pi Foundation’s resources (raspberrypi.org/help) offer comprehensive guides.
4. Development Tools and Environments
•	IDEs:
•	Arduino IDE: Download from the official Arduino website.
•	STM32CubeIDE: Available on STMicroelectronics’ website.
•	Keil uVision: Information and downloads available on Keil’s official website.
•	Version Control:
•	Git: Learn Git with "Pro Git" by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub, available for free online. Also, explore GitHub’s and GitLab’s own tutorials.
5. Real-world Projects
•	Project Ideas and Tutorials:
•	Instructables (instructables.com) and Hackster.io (hackster.io) are great platforms for finding project ideas and detailed tutorials.
•	Portfolio:
•	GitHub: Use GitHub to host your project code. GitHub Pages can be used to showcase your projects.
6. Continuous Learning
•	Stay Updated:
•	Embedded.com and Hackaday are good sources for news and articles on the latest in embedded systems.
•	Community Involvement:
•	Stack Overflow, Reddit (subreddits like r/embedded), and EEVblog Forum are active communities where you can ask questions and share knowledge.
7. Formal Education and Certifications
•	Online Education Platforms:
•	Coursera, edX, and Udacity offer courses and specializations in embedded systems and related fields.
•	Certifications:
•	IEEE offers the Certified Software Development Professional (CSDP) certification. Also, consider vendor-specific certifications from companies like ARM.
Remember, the key to success in embedded programming is a blend of theoretical knowledge and practical experience. Use these resources as a starting point, and don't hesitate to explore further based on your interests and the specific demands of your projects.
